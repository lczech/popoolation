# PoPoolation

PoPoolation is a pipeline for analysing pooled next generation sequencing data. Currently PoPoolation allows to calculate Tajima’s Pi, Watterson’s Theta and Tajima’s D with a sliding window approach for chromosomes or for set of genes. One of the main challenges in population genomics is to identify regions of intererest on a genome wide scale. We believe that PoPoolation will greatly aid this task by allowing a fast and user friendly analysis of NGS data from DNA pools.

# Repository

This repository is a clone of [PoPoolation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popoolation/) from SourceForge to GitHub. The original code was developed by [Robert Kofler](https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/population-genetics/research/research-groups/kofler-lab/group-leader/) and ported here with his explicit permission under the [BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License](https://github.com/lczech/popoolation/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

# Usage

At the moment, we here purely cloned the repository, without any modifications to its content. The [Wiki](https://github.com/lczech/popoolation/wiki) contains the tutorials as well, but was not yet adapted from the SourceForge-based `svn` commands to the GitHub-based `git` commands.
